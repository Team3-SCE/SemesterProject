Fundamentals of Software Engineering semester project.

The project was made with the waterfall engineering method and the code was written in C++.

The program has 3 kinds of interfaces, you can log in as an admin, as an agent, or as a customer.
The system can let new users sign up, the admin can give users agent privileges.
The users can contact the agents to order vacation packages and more.

The purpose of the software is to enable customers to buy easily travel packages and for the travel agency to be able to monitor and control the Database of reservations its benefits are that the travel agent will save a lot of time and manpower by using the software because the customer can do most of the work themselves by filling the forms and "order requirements".
